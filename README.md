# WDM Network Simulator with Genetic Algorithm

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project implements a WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) network simulator with dynamic traffic that uses a Genetic Algorithm to solve the RWA (Routing and Wavelength Assignment) problem. The simulator finds optimal lightpaths (route + wavelength combinations) to minimize blocking probability in optical networks.

- Genetic Algorithm for RWA optimization
- Dynamic traffic simulation in WDM networks
- K-shortest paths calculation for routing
- Blocking probability analysis
- Interactive result visualizations
- NSFNet topology support (14 nodes, 21 links)
